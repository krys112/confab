      <p>This website has been designed as a project to mimic an anonymous message board. The main focus of this project was to deploy a functional website created with MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS and ejs as a way to gain experience in full-stack development, albeit leaning towards back-end.<br><br>
        The following is a brief list of some of the features available:
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to create threads and posts, through express routes and storing/retrieving data in a MongoDB database using the npm package Mongoose</li>
          <li>Sorting and displaying threads, based on the most recent thread/post using the post number</li>
          <li>Attaching images to threads/posts using a file browser</li>
          <li>Storing attached images on the server which can then be displayed, this involved the use of the npm package Multer</li>
          <li>Displaying image specifications if necessary on a post, eg. file dimensions and size</li>
          <li>User feedback provided for certain errors, this is displayed through the use of the npm package connect-flash</li>
          <li>Basic authentication using PassportJS and express sessions in order to log into an administrator account capable of deleting threads/posts</li>
        </ul>
        <br>The primary resource used as the foundation has been the Web Developer Bootcamp course by Colt Steele available on Udemy: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a></p>
